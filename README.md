# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The Disaster Reporting Network is a nonprofit organization that provides data-driven storytelling on disasters around the world. Our job is to build data visualizations for interactive features on earthquakes from around the globe.

## Overview
1. Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
2. Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
3. Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
4. Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
5. Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
6. Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
7. Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
8. Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
9. Render maps on a local server.

## Results
### The default image is a street map showing earthquakes from around the world.

### Every dot on this map indicates an earthquake, and a popup shows the magnitude and location.

### The legend in the bottom right corner shows how the color of the dot also correlates to the magnitude of the earthquake.

### The interactive option in the top right corner lets users select which map they want to view, and then can choose the overlay(s) including earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates.

### Users can use any combination of map and overlay, such as the Satellite map with tectonic plate overlay.

### The light map option is great for viewing colors.  This is the light map option with all 3 overlays - earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.
